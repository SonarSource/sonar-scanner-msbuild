<!--
  This file defines properties which would be understood by the SonarQube.MsBuild.Runner, if not overridden (see below)
  By default the SonarQube.MsBuild.Runner.exe picks-up a file named SonarQube.Analysis.xml in the folder it
  is located (if it exists). It is possible to use another properties file by using the /s:filePath.xml flag
  
  The overriding strategy of property values is the following:
  - A property defined in the command line (/d:propertyName=value) has the top priority and so can override :
  - A property defined in an MSBuild project file (corresponding to a SonarQube module) which can override :
  - A property defined in the MSBuild.Analysis.xml configuration file [this file] which can override :
  - A property defined in the SonarQube User Interface at project level which can override:
  - A property defined in the SonarQube User Interface at global level which can't override anything.
  
  Note that the following properties cannot be set through an MSBuild project file or an SonarQube.Analysis.xml file:
  sonar.projectName, sonar.projectKey, sonar.projectVersion
  The following flags need to be used to set their value: /n:name /k:key /v:version
