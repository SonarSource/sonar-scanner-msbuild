      This file contains a targets to dump info about the projects being built and the
      set of files passed to the compiler for compilation for each project.
      The output will only be produced if the property $(DumpDir) is specified. $(DumpDir) is
      the output directory in which the output file should be dropped and can be relative or
      absolute (use an absolute path if you want a consolidated set of output for a single build).

      The full path to each project being built will be appended to a file called "ProjectList.txt"
      in the $(DumpDir).

      A subdirectory will be created for each project using the name of the project being built.
      The list of compiled files for that project will be written to the output file "CompileList.txt"

      Using this targets file
      - - - - - - - - - - - -
      To use these targets with a single project, import the targets into that project.

      To use these targets with all projects, put the file in:
          C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\12.0\Microsoft.Common.Targets\ImportAfter
      ... adjusting the MSBuild version as necessary.


      Example of use:
      - - - - - - - -
      msbuild MyProject.csproj /p:DumpDir=C:\CompileLists


      Caveats
      - - - -
      This is a very early prototype. There is almost no error handling and only
      superficial testing has been done.
