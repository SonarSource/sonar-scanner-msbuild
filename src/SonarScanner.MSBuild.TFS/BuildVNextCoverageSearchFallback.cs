// HACK: Workaround for SONARAZDO-179

// v2 of the AzureDevOps VSTest task may delete the .trx files from disc after it has uploaded them
// (it does this when using the distributed task runner (?) e.g. when running tests in parallel).
// We normally read .trx files to locate the .coverage files but obviously we can't do this if the
// files are not present.
//
// However, it doesn't delete the coverage files, but they will be written to a different location.
// This code is a partial workaround for the bug - if the normal .trx/.coverage process didn't work
// we'll fall back on searching for .coverage files in the secondary location.
// The test results from the .trx file will still be missing, but the code coverage will be found,
// which is more important.
